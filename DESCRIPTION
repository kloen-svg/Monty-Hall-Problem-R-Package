Description: This package allows users to simulate Monty Hall Problem data. There are a variety of functions for manual,
  step-by-step walk throughs of the problem, as well as nested functions that automate the entire process. There are also
  functions that allow for loooping simulations. In addition to the standard Monty Hall simulator, there is the capability
  for users to define their own scenario with any number of goats or cars (provided they adhere to the minimums of the orignal
  problem setup of two goats and one car).
