This is a project in my Master's program where we were tasked with creating a package in R from scratch and hosting it on Github for others to install.
In this case, it is a Monty Hall Problem simulator (as made famous in Brooklyn 99). Based on a classic game show in the vein of "Let's Make a Deal" where contestants are presented with three doors.
One door has a car and two doors have a goat. The contestant is given the opportunity to change their selection after a door containing a goat is revealed.
This has been the subject of much study in statistics.
The standard 3 door scenario is included as a function, as is a scenario wherein users can specify a number of goats and cars as prizes.
The fully nested functions simulate the outcomes of both strategies of staying vs changing doors.
